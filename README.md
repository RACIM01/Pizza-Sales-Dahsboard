Project Focus: Power BI Desktop
This project revolves around the utilization of a key business intelligence tool, specifically Microsoft Power BI Desktop. The dataset employed for this project originates from a pizza shop and is sourced from the internet in CSV format, encompassing more than 45,000 rows. To enhance accessibility and usability, the CSV file has been imported into a Microsoft SQL Server database, serving as the primary data source for Power BI.

The primary objectives of this initiative include:

*Conducting data cleaning and transformation tasks using Power BI.

*Acquiring proficiency in the DAX language for the formulation of functions.

*Generating comprehensive reports within Power BI featuring interactive graphs spanning across multiple pages.
